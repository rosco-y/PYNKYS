# PYNKYS
Adding Game For Everyone
---
When I was a kid, we had a corner store up the street called "Pinkies".  I remember Pinkies when someone mentions a "Mom & Pop" corner store.

Mrs. Pinkie was a big woman with fair skin and was pretty in her too-much-makeup way, and Mr. Pinkie was a little round and going Bald.  Mr. and Mrs. Pinkie had a lot of patience for us kids; they knew our names and always had smiles although we rarely spent more that a nickel at a time.  If not for living in Rural Minnesota in my later youth, Pinkies Corner Store would certainly be the last place where us kids could go to the store and pick out the Groceries that Mom wanted, and tell them to "put it on the tab."  Dad stopped in on paydays and paid the tab.

There are lots of new softwares that come out these days, promising to strengthen our minds with daily use.  I believe they do, it makes sense to me.  I also believe that you don't need to be tricky exercise our minds.  A simple addition game is all it takes, and you can see big improvements in your adding abilities almost on a daily basis if you stick with it.

The thing about an addition game, is that it doesn't need a lot of explaination.  "Add up the numbers." pretty much covers it.  PYNKYS starts so easy you will almost be embarrassed to be playing it.  Even though each levels is only minutely more difficult than the previous, often so little that it is almost imperceptable, soon you will find yourself just a tad overconfident and making the most minute errors, which hold you at the current level until it is mastered.  Rather than beating yourself up for making a mistake, you will likely slap yourself on the forehead and say "oh shoot, I'll be more careful this time."

The thing is that it's so easy to learn and engaging that even the very young soon they are masters of addition rules that evade the majority of the population who use checkbooks every day.

I guarantee that you'll have more fun doing simple arithmatic than you have with any other game or your money back!  You might be suspicious of someone who can make such a claim, but remember, you didn't pay any money to install and play PYNKYS as much as you want!

I'm new to game development, and just learning how to build games with Unity, and I'm making very slow progess in finishing this, but I'm truly excited by the prospect of finishing PYNKYS, and I will certainly be crowing on the day I can publish it anywhere.
